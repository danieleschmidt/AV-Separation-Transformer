# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the AV-Separation-Transformer project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help us understand the reasoning behind architectural choices and their trade-offs.

## ADR Format

Each ADR should follow this template:

```markdown
# [ADR-####] [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## References
- Links to related documentation
- External resources
- Related ADRs
```

## Naming Convention

ADRs should be named using the following format:
- `ADR-XXXX-short-title.md`
- Where XXXX is a 4-digit number (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Use lowercase with hyphens for the title

## Current ADRs

- [ADR-0001](ADR-0001-transformer-architecture.md) - Multi-Modal Transformer Architecture Choice
- [ADR-0002](ADR-0002-webrtc-integration.md) - WebRTC Integration Strategy
- [ADR-0003](ADR-0003-deployment-strategy.md) - Multi-Platform Deployment Strategy

## Contributing

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new ADR following the template
2. Discuss the decision with the team
3. Update the status once the decision is finalized
4. Reference the ADR in related code and documentation
