## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of AV-Separation-Transformer seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report Privately

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing: security@example.com

Include the following information:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of affected source files
- Location of affected code (tag/branch/commit)
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact assessment

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days for critical issues

## Security Measures

### Input Validation

- All audio inputs are validated for format and size
- Video inputs are checked for malicious content
- File uploads are restricted to allowed formats
- Input size limits are enforced

### Model Security

- Model weights are cryptographically signed
- Checksums verify model integrity
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Resource limits prevent DoS attacks

### Data Privacy

- No user data is collected without consent
- Audio/video processing is done locally
- Temporary files are securely deleted
- No telemetry without opt-in

### Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Security advisories monitoring
- Minimal dependency footprint

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Software Updated**
   - Use the latest stable version
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Monitor security advisories

2. **Secure Deployment**
   - Use HTTPS for API endpoints
   - Implement authentication
   - Enable rate limiting
   - Monitor for anomalies

3. **Data Handling**
   - Process sensitive data locally
   - Encrypt data in transit
   - Implement access controls
   - Audit data access

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**
   - Security-focused code reviews
   - Static analysis tools
   - Dependency checking
   - Input validation

2. **Testing**
   - Security test cases
   - Fuzzing inputs
   - Penetration testing
   - Vulnerability scanning

## Known Security Considerations

### Resource Exhaustion

Large video files can consume significant memory. Implement:
- File size limits
- Processing timeouts
- Memory monitoring
- Request throttling

### Model Poisoning

Pre-trained models could be compromised. Mitigate with:
- Official model sources only
- Checksum verification
- Model signing
- Anomaly detection

### Privacy Concerns

Audio-visual processing has privacy implications:
- Process data locally when possible
- Implement data retention policies
- Provide user controls
- Document data usage

- [ ] Security patches applied
- [ ] HTTPS configured
- [ ] Authentication enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Logging configured
- [ ] Monitoring enabled
