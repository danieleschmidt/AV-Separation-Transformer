## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in AV-Separation-Transformer, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to daniel.schmidt@terragonlabs.com
2. **Subject Line**: "[SECURITY] AV-Separation-Transformer Vulnerability Report"
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fixes (if any)
   - Your contact information

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: We'll send updates every 7 days during investigation
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Security Response Process

1. **Triage**: Assess severity and impact
2. **Investigation**: Reproduce and analyze the issue
3. **Fix Development**: Create and test security patches
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Work with reporter on disclosure timeline
5. **Public Disclosure**: Release security advisory and patched versions
6. **Post-Mortem**: Review process and improve security measures

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- **Local Processing**: Audio/video data is processed locally by default
- **No Data Retention**: The library doesn't store or transmit user data
- **Encryption**: All network communications use TLS 1.3
- **Model Security**: Pre-trained models are cryptographically signed

### Model Security

- **Adversarial Robustness**: Models are tested against adversarial audio attacks
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Resource Limits**: Built-in protections against resource exhaustion
- **Secure Loading**: Model files are verified before loading

### Deployment Security

#### Docker Security

- Run containers as non-root user
- Use minimal base images (distroless)
- Scan for vulnerabilities regularly
- Limit container resources

```dockerfile
# Secure container example
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3
USER 65534:65534
COPY --chown=65534:65534 . /app
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

#### WebRTC Security

- Enable DTLS for data channels
- Use TURN servers with authentication
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate all WebRTC signaling

```javascript
// Secure WebRTC configuration
const configuration = {
    iceServers: [
        {
            urls: 'turns:turn.example.com:443',
            username: 'user',
            credential: 'pass'
        }
    ],
    iceCandidatePoolSize: 10,
    bundlePolicy: 'max-bundle',
    rtcpMuxPolicy: 'require'
};
```

### API Security

- **Authentication**: Implement proper API authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with rate limiting
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate all API inputs
- **Error Handling**: Don't leak sensitive information in errors

```python
# Secure API example
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

app = Flask(__name__)
limiter = Limiter(
    app,
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["200 per day", "50 per hour"]
)

@app.route('/separate', methods=['POST'])
@limiter.limit("10 per minute")
def separate_audio():
    # Validate input
    if not request.is_json:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid content type'}), 400
    
    # Process securely
    try:
        result = separator.process(request.json)
        return jsonify(result)
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error without exposing details
        logger.error(f"Separation failed: {e}")
        return jsonify({'error': 'Processing failed'}), 500
```

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning

We use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
safety check
pip-audit

# Static code analysis
bandit -r av_separation/
semgrep --config=auto av_separation/

# Container scanning
docker scan av-separation:latest
trivy image av-separation:latest
```

### Manual Security Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security audits
- **Adversarial Testing**: Regular testing against adversarial inputs
- **Fuzzing**: Automated fuzzing of audio/video inputs
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes

## Threat Model

### Threat Actors

1. **Malicious Users**: Attempting to crash or exploit the system
2. **Adversarial Attackers**: Trying to fool the ML models
3. **Privacy Attackers**: Attempting to extract sensitive information
4. **Resource Attackers**: Trying to exhaust system resources

### Attack Vectors

1. **Adversarial Audio**: Crafted audio inputs to fool separation
2. **Model Extraction**: Attempting to steal model weights
3. **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion attacks
4. **Data Exfiltration**: Attempting to access processed data
5. **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies or models

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all inputs
2. **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and time limits
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Monitoring for unusual patterns
4. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all components
5. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines
2. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets to code
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information
5. **Logging**: Log security events appropriately

### For Deployments

1. **Network Security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
2. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor for security events and anomalies
4. **Updates**: Keep systems and dependencies updated
5. **Backup**: Secure backup and recovery procedures

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Use the latest version of the library
2. **Validate Inputs**: Don't process untrusted audio/video without validation
3. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate resource limits in production
4. **Monitor Usage**: Monitor for unusual behavior or performance
5. **Report Issues**: Report suspected security issues promptly

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Contain the incident and assess impact
2. **Communication**: Notify affected users and stakeholders
3. **Investigation**: Thoroughly investigate the root cause
4. **Remediation**: Deploy fixes and security improvements
5. **Post-Incident**: Conduct post-mortem and update procedures

## Legal

We work with security researchers under responsible disclosure principles. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Report vulnerabilities responsibly and in good faith
- Don't access or modify user data beyond what's necessary for research
- Don't publicly disclose vulnerabilities before we've had a chance to fix them
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
