## Version History

### Versioning Scheme

We use Semantic Versioning:
- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Upgrade Guide

#### From 0.x to 1.0

1. Update configuration format:
   ```python
   # Old
   separator = AVSeparator(num_speakers=2)
   
   # New
   config = SeparatorConfig()
   separator = AVSeparator(num_speakers=2, config=config)
   ```

2. Model checkpoint format changed:
   - Re-download pre-trained models
   - Update custom checkpoint loading code

3. API changes:
   - `separate()` now returns List[np.ndarray]
   - `process_stream()` renamed to `separate_stream()`

### Deprecation Notice

The following features will be removed in v2.0:
- Legacy model format support
- Python 3.8 support
- Old configuration system
