# AV-Separation-Transformer Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: AV-Separation-Transformer  
**Project Owner**: Daniel Schmidt  
**Start Date**: January 2025  
**Target Completion**: June 2025 (v1.0)  
**Budget**: $500K development + $200K infrastructure

## Problem Statement

Current video conferencing solutions struggle with the "cocktail party problem" - separating multiple speakers in noisy, multi-speaker environments. This leads to:

- **Poor Communication Quality**: Background voices interfere with primary speakers
- **Cognitive Load**: Participants strain to focus on relevant speakers
- **Accessibility Issues**: Hearing-impaired users cannot distinguish speakers
- **Professional Impact**: Important information gets lost in meetings
- **Technical Limitations**: Existing solutions are computationally expensive or inaccurate

### Market Impact
- 3+ billion video conference participants globally
- $47B video conferencing market size (2023)
- 73% of users report audio quality issues in meetings
- 45% productivity loss due to poor audio clarity
