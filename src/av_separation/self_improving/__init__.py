ðŸ§  Self-Improving AI Architecture
Advanced meta-learning and continual adaptation capabilities

This module implements cutting-edge self-improving AI capabilities including:
- Meta-learning for rapid task adaptation (MAML)
- Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for auto-optimization
- Continual learning without catastrophic forgetting
- Experience replay and elastic weight consolidation
- Performance monitoring and auto-improvement triggers

Components:
- AdaptationConfig: Configuration for self-improvement
- MetaLearner: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning implementation
- NeuralArchitectureSearch: Automated architecture optimization
- ContinualLearner: Lifelong learning without forgetting
- SelfImprovingModel: Complete self-improving wrapper
