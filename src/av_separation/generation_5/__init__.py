TERRAGON GENERATION 5: AUTONOMOUS INTELLIGENCE ENHANCEMENT

This module implements the next evolution beyond Generation 4 Transcendence,
introducing truly autonomous system intelligence and evolution capabilities.

Key Features:
- Autonomous code generation and optimization
- Self-evolving neural architectures  
- Intelligent system monitoring and adaptation
- Autonomous bug detection and fixing
- Dynamic performance optimization
- Self-documenting systems

Generation 5 Paradigms:
1. AUTONOMOUS EVOLUTION: Systems that evolve without human intervention
2. INTELLIGENT MONITORING: AI-driven system health and optimization
3. SELF-HEALING: Automatic bug detection and resolution
4. ADAPTIVE LEARNING: Continuous learning from system behavior
5. EMERGENT INTELLIGENCE: Systems that develop new capabilities
